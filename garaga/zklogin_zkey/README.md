## File Structure

- `Scarb.toml`: A configuration file for managing project dependencies and compilation options.

- `src`:
    - `groth16_verifier.cairo`: The main file for the Groth16 verifier, responsible for implementing the core logic of zero-knowledge proof verification
    - `groth16_verifier_constants.cairo`: Contains constants used in the Groth16 verification process, typically for setting circuit parameters or fixed verification values.
    - `lib.cairo`: A library file providing common functions or supporting features, likely including mathematical operations and data handling.

## Code Introduction

This project integrates a Groth16 zero-knowledge proof verifier to support privacy authentication within ZKLogin. Below are the roles of the main modules:

1. **Groth16 Verifier**: `groth16_verifier.cairo` implements a zero-knowledge proof verifier based on the Groth16 proof system, allowing for proof verification without revealing the actual user data.

2. **Verifier Constants**: `groth16_verifier_constants.cairo` defines fixed parameters and constants used during verification, ensuring the verification logic's stability and security.

3. **Library Functions**: `lib.cairo` provides auxiliary functions, such as mathematical operations or commonly used tools, to support the verifier module.
